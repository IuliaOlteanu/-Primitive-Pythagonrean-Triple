# Primitive-Pythagonrean-Triple

Implemented algorithms that generate an infinite tree of TPP based triples and quartets, implemented a cryptosystem with symmetrical keys where the key is generated based on the theory of the Pythagorean triplets. This was a project for “Programming Paradigms”, a college course which helped me to abstract and code in a “wishful thinking” manner.
